        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img id="bio-pic" src="assets/images/SundayFunday-286.jpg" alt="MAN-portrait" width="20%">
        <p>My name is Monica Nadal. I live and work in Los Angeles, California. I have my bachelors from the University
            of California--Irvine in Film & Media Studies and Political Science. I am a media technology professional,
            specializing in finding creative technical solutions for clients and for b2b organizations.</p>
        <p>As a consumer of different technologies and media, and with a background in marketing, media engineering, and
            as an avid admirer of art and design, I believe in interactions with our tools should not only be
            functional, but intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <p>In my professional life, I live by a couple of mantras. The first is that the right answer is the right
            answer, no matter who it comes from. This means that no one should be afraid to contribute, and no one's ego
            should be too big to listen. The second mantra I live by is that being a leader isn't about always being the
            smartest person in the room. In fact, I might go as far as to say that if you're all around the smartest
            person in the room, you're in the wrong damn room. Being a leader is about surrounding yourself with smart,
            capable people and knowing when to listen. Being a leader means fostering the people around you so you can
            all grow together.</p>
        <p>In terms of professional interests, I am fascinated by web design, solutions architecture, media engineering,
            UI/UX, and legal implications of intellectual property and privacy. My personal interests and hobbies
            include writing, photography, reading (fiction, non-fiction, the backs of cereal boxes), being quietly
            inappropriate at art museums, and general pretentious a$$hat stuff.</p>

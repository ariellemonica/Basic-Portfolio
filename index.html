        <img id="bio-pic" src="assets/images/SundayFunday-286.jpg" alt="MAN-portrait" width="20%">
        <p>My name is Monica Nadal. I live and work in Los Angeles, California. I have my bachelors from the University
            of California--Irvine in Film & Media Studies and Political Science. I am a media technology professional,
            specializing in finding creative technical solutions for clients and for b2b organizations.</p>
        <p>As a consumer of different technologies and media, and with a background in marketing, media engineering, and
            as an avid admirer of art and design, I believe in interactions with our tools should not only be
            functional, but intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <p>In terms of professional interests, I am fascinated by web design, solutions architecture, media engineering,
            UI/UX, and legal implications of intellectual property and privacy. My personal interests and hobbies
            include writing, photography, reading (fiction, non-fiction, the backs of cereal boxes), being quietly
            inappropriate at art museums, and general pretentious a$$hat stuff.</p>
